Welcome to Taniwha
You play the role of a Taniwha from Maori legend.
No Taniwha has ever been seen so don't let the
divers take a photo of you and reach the surface.
Luckily you have laser eyes so you can fry them.
Do Taniwha's have laser eyes? Probably.
Uses W,A,S,D to move, mouse to target and space to fire.
Also has controller support.
Press the any key to start.
